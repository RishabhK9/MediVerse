**MediVerse** is an AI-powered pre-surgical assistant designed to streamline the pre-surgical process, helping healthcare providers improve patient outcomes and reduce physician burnout. By capturing and organizing critical pre-op information, MediVerse automates and simplifies the workflow, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for MediVerse came from observing the time-consuming and fragmented pre-surgical process. We saw an opportunity to leverage advanced AI and cloud technologies to make this phase of patient care more efficient, potentially improving outcomes and reducing physician burnout.

## Features
- **Multi-Language Pre-Op Capture:** Captures pre-op notes through voice or text in multiple languages.
- **Endoscopy Video Analysis:** Uses computer vision to detect anomalies in endoscopy videos.
- **Real-Time Transcription:** Automatically transcribes spoken observations during procedures.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Compiles all data into a structured report using Google Cloud's BigQuery.
- **Intuitive Workflow:** Provides a smooth workflow from initial data collection to final report generation.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js
- **Backend:** Express.js, Node.js
- **AI and ML Tools:** NLX for natural language processing, OpenCV for computer vision
- **Cloud Services:** Google Cloud (BigQuery, Storage), Google’s Speech-to-Text API
- **Other:** Python for data processing

## How It Works
1. **Data Capture:** Healthcare providers input pre-op notes via voice or text in multiple languages.
2. **Video Analysis:** Analyzes endoscopy video feeds using computer vision for real-time anomaly detection.
3. **Transcription:** Transcribes real-time spoken observations during procedures to reduce manual entry.
4. **Data Organization:** Compiles and organizes data into a report, accessible for the healthcare team.
5. **Workflow Management:** Provides an end-to-end solution from data capture to comprehensive reporting.

## Challenges
